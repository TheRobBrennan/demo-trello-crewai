# Bug Fix: Handling Empty Trello Lists

## Issue Description

The application was unnecessarily calling out to external services and generating imaginary content when there were 0 cards in the Trello TODO list to process. This resulted in wasted API calls and potentially confusing output.

## Fix Implementation

The following changes were made to address this issue:

1. Modified `prepare_inputs` method in `src/pro_tools/crew.py` to raise a specific `ValueError` when no cards are found in the TODO list, instead of continuing with empty inputs.

2. Updated the `run` function in `src/pro_tools/main.py` to catch this specific exception and handle it gracefully with a clear message to the user.

3. Added a test case in `src/pro_tools/tests/test_no_cards.py` to verify that the fix correctly handles the case when no cards are found.

## Testing

The fix has been tested by:

1. Unit testing with mocked Trello API responses to simulate an empty list.
2. Manual testing by running the application with an empty Trello list.

## How to Verify

To verify this fix:

1. Ensure your Trello TODO list is empty.
2. Run the application using `python -m src.pro_tools.main run`.
3. The application should exit gracefully with a message indicating that there are no cards to process, without making unnecessary API calls or generating content.

## Additional Notes

This fix improves the efficiency of the application by avoiding unnecessary processing when there's no work to be done, and provides clearer feedback to the user about the state of their Trello board.
